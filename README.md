Background Information

Mima is a startup film company that aims to enter the film industry.
As a data scientist consultant working for the startup, you're required to perform an
analysis and provide recommendations on the kinds of movies that the startup should
create in order to have a profitable business.

After sourcing for an existing movie dataset and using your existing knowledge of the
Matplotlib library, you start work on your analysis which entails answering the following
questions:

● Do movies with a higher budget end up being popular?

● Does the length of the movie affect the vote count and popularity?

● Does higher popularity mean higher profits?

● What features are associated with the top 10 revenue movies?

● Which genres are most popular from year to year?


Dataset

● Dataset CSV (URL): http://bit.ly/MoviesDS

● This dataset contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie
Database (TMDb).

● Columns like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|)
characters.

● You can leave out the characters in the ‘cast’ column.

● The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the
associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.
